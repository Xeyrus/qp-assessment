Problem Statement:
Design a Grocery Booking API:
Roles:
- Admin
- User



Design API endpoints
1. Admin Responsibilities:
   - Add new grocery items to the system        			---> Post by admin
   - View existing grocery items 					---> Get by admin
   - Remove grocery items from the system 				---> Delete by admin
   - Update details (e.g., name, price) of existing grocery items  	---> Put by admin
   - Manage inventory levels of grocery items 				---> Put by admin
2. User Responsibilities:
   - View the list of available grocery items  				---> Get by user
   - Ability to book multiple grocery items in a single order		---> Put by user
Advanced Challenge:
- Containerize the application using Docker for ease of deployment and scaling.
Database:
- Use any relational database of your choice.				---> MySQL
